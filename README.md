# Lymphoma-spatial

This repository includes the codes used for generating the main results presented in the paper Multi-modal spatial characterization of tumor-immune microenvironments identifies targetable inflammatory niches in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The code was originally developed in R (version 4.2.0), with softwares as detailed in the manuscript. To be compatible with updated versions, the code has also been tested in R (version 4.3.1), with the following required packages:
Seurat (version 5.1.0);
SeuratObject (version 5.0.2);
ggplot2 (version 3.5.1);
dplyr (version 1.1.4);
tidyverse (version 2.0.0);
reshape2 (version 1.4.4);
plotly (version 4.10.4)

Please refer to the folder R/ for related code. A detailed description of the function of each part of code is provided in the related scripts.
